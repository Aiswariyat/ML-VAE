# VAE Model

This repository contains the implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using TensorFlow and Keras. The VAE is trained on a dataset of images and can generate new images with similar characteristics. Additionally, the repository includes scripts for evaluating the trained model using various metrics such as FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance), KID (Kernel Inception Distance), PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and Inception Score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

### Dataset

The VAE model is trained on a dataset located in the `data/training` directory. The dataset should be organized into classes, with each class in a separate subdirectory.

The testing dataset is located in the `data/testing` directory.

### Results
The results, including FID, KID, PSNR, and Inception Scores, are saved in CSV files for analysis. The files are named fid_kid_scores.csv, output_psnr.csv, and inception_scores.csv.

Additionally, loss plots during training are saved in the Models/None_Models directory.
